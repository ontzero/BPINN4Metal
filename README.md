# BPINN4Metal
**Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (BPINN) for Metal Property Prediction**
This version:
- **Core modeling part** âœ… Works fine, network structure, physical loss function, and Bayesian inference are all done;
- **Early stopping logic** ðŸ”„ Basic implementation is there (based on validation set coverage and MSE improvement), but it's still a bit rough, so I'll update it once I've cleaned up the code;
- **Complete optimized version** ðŸ“¦ Will be updated after subsequent code cleanup.
